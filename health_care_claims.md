Short Name | Description
-----------|---------------
CMS | Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
Payor | Typically for any insurance company. Aka – Aetna, BCBS etc

Covid19 | The current virus may also be termed as CV19
Claims | The form used by: Hospital, Doctor, Physician, Nurses, Anesthesiologist to bill and obtain remittance for services.
State Health Agency | Too many to name – but various states have agencies focused on patient care and billing.  Sometimes these agencies work in coordination or tandem with CMS and or County Agencies or Large municipal city agencies.
County Health Agency | Too many to name – but various states have agencies focused on patient care and billing.  Sometimes these agencies work in coordination or tandem with CMS and or County Agencies or Large municipal city agencies.
Government Agencies | Simplified way to describe: State, County, Municipal agencies – and may often include CMS.
Service Providers | Simplified way to describe: Hospitals, Nurses who bill separately, Anesthesiologists, XRay technicians and any provider of services that “bill” using claims to Government Agencies and/or Payors.
Procedure Codes | On typical medical claims – these are codes that describe what medical procedures were performed on a patient for that episode of care.  There can be many procedures. There is typically a principal procedure followed by secondary procedures.  Depending on the type of claim – there can be up to 25 codes that describe what procedures were performed on a patient.
Diagnosis Codes | On typical medical claims – these are codes that describe what medical diagnosis was observed on a patient for that episode of care.  There can be multiple diagnosis codes on a claim.  Depending on the type of claim – there can be up to 25 codes that describe what diagnosis a patient has.
Data Sources | These are places and ways data for patients originate.
Data Destinations | These are places where after either a short period of time or longer data is then able to be researched either publicly and/or restricted to those with the right credentials and access. For example:  Payors often do not share data.  Government Agencies have different types of patient claim data they release to allow research and detection of fraud
Third Party Entities | May include University research, Private/Public technology company for research and or independent researchers.  This may or may not be projects that are funded by grants or simply corporate work.
VRDC | A CMS funded data repository that is highly restricted and although open to research the difficulty of gaining access and costs mean there are few with access to this system and data.
HIPPA | a law protecting patient privacy.  This explanation is not meant to be a legal one but a simplified explanation to understand how: Payors, Patients, Third Party Entities, Government Agencies – all work with this law to ensure the best protection of patient privacy possible.  The fundamental rule is that no details of a patient shall be made public or allowed to be made public with out explicit consent of said patient. And in the case of scenarios where a health topic is concerned that “someone” is discussing details – a group of patients (small) made identified via a description of medical and health terms a violation of privacy is considered when the NUMBER of patients is so small that it is therefore possible to conclude which members of a geographic region constitute said “patients”.  As such the privacy of said group or patient is infringed. 
DUA | Data Usage Agreement – This is a term that CMS has and other Government Agencies. Where a specific set of restrictions and rules are placed on data requested for research and study.  The DUA is a contract and is meant to strictly define the requirements and expectations of the data and the organization and or person studying and requesting the data.  More details later on DUA.  A company, Third Party Entity, Payor may meet the requirements to enter a DUA and obtain access to CMA and or Government Agency patient data.
BPCI | Bundled Payments for Care Improvement  When you start to understand where this industry is going and how BPCI can help its pretty cool. However that is if its really done correctly.  There are issues to parts of this process. At present its my opinion that something is better than nothing. Further that agencies like CMS and Goverment Agencies as well as Care providers are generally trying to improve the process.  With payor insurance industry sharing the desire to improve but often obscured by its corporate veils of seeking revenue.  I cant totally blame everyone or one specific entity.

### Lets Start
So there are a variety of terms to be aware of as "claims" become a topic.
The idea that there is fraud in medical claims exists.  It has long existed.
And there are a number of methods that fraud is identified in the long and difficult medical billing process.
The parties interested in protecting from "medical fraud" are simple: Payors, Government Agencies and by extension Hospitals and Doctors. 
Further down the line are patients who also are concerned with medical billing issues. Often they are the ones to find issues.

This identification of issues or errors on claims also occurs. 
Fraud would manifest when there is obviously a claim error that is not accidental or when made intentional to allow someone to profit.
This is not meant to be a legal definition. I am simply stating that - there is a long history of greed manifesting in this industry.
So from this point on we can describe in a simple way - Billing Errors - as ones which are not intended to be related to Fraud.  And Fraud Billing to be those that were never meant to be anything but manipulation or billing for profit.

This topic came about because over the last few weeks from late April 2020 thru May 2020 I was observing memes or threads on social media that describe a scenario in which Medical Billing would manipulate to include "Covid19" for additional profit.

To me with my limited knowledge - I can see where this might be a very over simplified understanding and give anyone that impression.
However even with my limited knowledge - I can grasp what the "Government Agencies" are asking health service providers to do and as such give the wrong impression.

### Cut to the Point
Look - i'll save you lots more reading if you'd like...
1. If you think there is fraud - there are ways for you to gain access to public health claims data and find such fraud and also potentially make money.
2. If you think the fraud is going to happen - I can assure you there are numerous places and ways that if not right away - eventually it will be spotted and identified.  AKA - the money doesnt just disappear and appear in this business. Its got lots of data trails.
3. If you think the fraud already happened - See Item 1 - study up and see where you can find it.  The Government Whistleblower type rewards are real and you could put that social media trolling thing to work and make money not just waste someone elses time.

So - here - I dont have all the various links - but I will add them here over time.
Data is eventually made available and shared - although - its made anonymous to protect patient privacy.

So back to the idea that "someone" will just add "Covid19" and that is going to push numbers and money up for say the idea of getting more money.
That can only work for a very limited scenario and set of claims and time.
The doctors, hospitals, "service providers" - ultimately have these claims to file and they are bound by rules of accuracy and ethics.

So - I think an excellent question is "Does the USA Federal Declaration of Healthcare Emergency Absolve hospitals and service providers from liability of Medical Claim Fraud".
I dont have any indication (as of 5/11/2020) that this is the case.
Quite the contrary - although I do think that the Gov't Emergency Declaration has protected "service providers" from medical malpractice liability - lets go back to a basic rule - "money talks".
Those claims become key in any legal scenario where someone might later want to question a high rate of mortality for: Hospital, Doctor etc.
These service providers literally work very carefully to ensure not risking not just malpractice but billing fraud cases.
The fraud billing type are NOT typically covered by medical malpractice.  Hence if YOU spot something like fraud - its where you can claim a reward in many cases.

So this is why to me - imho - this scenario of service providers messing with claims to get more money - doesnt hold up with proper perspective of the billing and insurance process.
So while our patients may see a emergency care scenario right now where they enter a hospital and get all sorts of treatments, procedures and so on.
The people administering this will only push it carefully and to the extent that the scenario really does apply - but not just add a "procedure" or "item" because of making money.

That patient that did have a shark bite - and was treated and released or sadly died is not going to (under common scenarios) see a different procedure, diagnosis added to that claim.
Because the people later on who will pay for that claim will ask for that money back.
And if enough "errors" occur and are spotted - yes - greed will overcome and someone will file for fraud claims and rewards.

Not just Government Agencies but Payors and Patients.

In a later update to this I'll describe what BPCI is and why that matters to most of us and certainly to many of those who need healthcare at an affordable cost.
